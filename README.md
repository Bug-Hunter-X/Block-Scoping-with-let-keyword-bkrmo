# Block Scoping in JavaScript

This example demonstrates how the `let` keyword in JavaScript creates block scope.

The inner `x` variable inside the `if` block is different from the outer `x` variable. This is because `let` declares a variable that is only accessible within the block of code it's defined in. 

## How to Run

1. Save the code in `bug.js`
2. Open your browser's developer console.
3. Copy and paste the code into the console and press Enter.
4. Observe the output.
